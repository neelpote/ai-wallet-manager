- ✅ **Natural Quantities**: "some", "a little", "everything"
- ✅ **Percentage Calculations**: Automatically calculates from your actual balance

### **3. Intelligent Error Handling**
- ✅ **Friendly Errors**: Clear, helpful error messages with suggestions

- ✅ **Emergency Language**: "lock", "emergency", "stop" = freeze wallet
- ✅ **Contextual Commands**: References to previous conversation

## 🗣️ **NATURAL LANGUAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Instead of rigid commands, now you can say:**

```bash
# OLD WAY (still works):
"Send 10 XLM to GXXX..."
"Swap 100 XLM to USDC"
"Set daily limit to 500"

# NEW WAY (natural language):
"Can you send some stellar to my friend Alice?"
"I want to trade half my lumens for dollars"
"Make my wallet safer with spending limits"
"Is everything secure right now?"
"What should I do with my assets?"
"Lock everything down!" (emergency freeze)
"How much is my USDC worth in stellar?"
"Trade some aqua tokens for euros"
```

### **Smart Amount Recognition:**
```bash
"Swap half my XLM to USDC" → Calculates 50% of your XLM balance
"Send all my USDC to Alice" → Uses your entire USDC balance
"Set limit to 10% of my balance" → Calculates 10% automatically
"Trade some stellar for dollars" → Suggests reasonable amount
```

### **Typo & Alias Handling:**
```bash
"Swap 100 XML to USDC" → AI knows you mean XLM
"Convert stellar to dollars" → XLM to USDC
"Trade lumens for euros" → XLM to EURC
"Send some aquarius tokens" → Recognizes AQUA
```

### **Emergency & Security:**
```bash
"Lock my wallet!" → freeze_wallet
"Emergency stop!" → freeze_wallet
"Is my wallet safe?" → get_spending_info
"Make it secure" → Shows security options
"What's my protection status?" → Security overview
```
